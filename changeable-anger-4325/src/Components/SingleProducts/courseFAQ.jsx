                No, we won't charge you at this time. However, there is a $1 USD
                hold that is immediately released. You may see a charge of $1 on
                your account, but it will be reversed. After your trial ends,
                we'll use this information to create your account, so you can
                continue to build new skills with uninterrupted access to our
                platform.
