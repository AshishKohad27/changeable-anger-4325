      "whatYouWillLearn": "Building efficient web and mobile interfaces is often challenging and requires the use of imperative logic. React enables you to declaratively describe user interfaces in terms of their state, and it will do the heavy lifting of natively building them for you. In this course, React: Getting Started, you will delve into the fundamental concepts about React and use them to build practical web applications. First, you will see how to design class components and stateful function component, how to one-way flow data and behavior in a component tree, and how to read and update state elements. Then, you will delve into modern JavaScript features used with React like arrow functions, destructuring rest and spread operators, classes, async/await, and more. Next, you will learn some core React tasks like taking input from the user, reading data from an API, managing side effects like timers, and sharing stateful logic with custom hooks. Finally, you will explore how to configure and use a local JavaScript development environment on your machine. When you are finished with this course, you will have the skills and knowledge you need to understand React projects, and start simple React applications from scratch.",

      "whatYouWillLearn": "Routing in single page applications like those written in React.js helps to display the right content and components, but static routing can be very limiting. In this course, Client Side React Router 4, you'll learn how react-router-4 offers far more capability with dynamic routing and provides a unique model for routing in React.js applications. First, you'll learn the fundamentals of routing in react-router-4. Next, you'll begin to put react-router to work and by nesting and testing routes. Finally, you'll dive deep into advanced route handling techniques with React.js and even handle routing state in redux. By the end of this course, you'll have a very good working grasp of React Router 4 and its new dynamic programming model, which will change the way you write React code.",

      "whatYouWillLearn": "Forms are the primary mode of collecting user input on web apps. In this course, Implementing Forms in React, you will learn to create forms for your web app that are not only performant, user friendly, and consistent but are built using components that are reusable and have rock solid data validation.\n\nFirst, you will explore how a basic form works with Vanilla React and how to manage its state and handle user input. You will also see how to create a form using a library called Formik to avoid writing a whole lot of boilerplate code that is needed when using Vanilla React.\n\nNext, you will explore adding sync and async data validation to your forms using the various mechanisms provided by Formik and how to create custom self-sufficient form elements that can be reused across screens in your app to provide that consistent look and experience to the end user.\n\nFinally, you will learn how to implement uncontrolled forms and alternative ways of implementing forms that rely solely on uncontrolled components like the React Hook Form library and what advantages that brings.\n\nWhen you are finished with this course, you will be very comfortable creating forms in React that can not only support a wide variety of user inputs but are smooth, consistent, and air tight when collecting data from the user.",
